# Google Cloud IoT Core samples

This folder contains samples of the [device](../common) implemented using the Google Cloud IoT Core.

## Quickstart

These samples are similar to the ones [provided by Google](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/nodejs-docs-samples/blob/master/iot). To get started
1. Follow [these instructions](https://cloud.google.com/iot/docs/how-tos/devices) on creating the cloud, registry and device. When creating the registry, create a topic named _data_ for telemetry data and another named _state_ for state data.
1. See the specific sample README.md in this repository.
